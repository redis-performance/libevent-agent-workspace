# libevent-agent-workspace — Experiments Log

Append-only. One `## EXP-NNN` section per experiment, newest at the bottom.
Use `experiments/TEMPLATE.md` for the entry format. Failures are as valuable as wins —
log every rejection with its reason.

Metric reminder: **never MB/s**. Report microseconds per `run_once` (lower=better),
events/sec, and syscall count.

<!-- EXP-001 starts here. Run `EXP_ID=EXP-001 scripts/select.sh` to begin the first loop,
     after capturing a baseline with `EXP=EXP-001 BASELINE=1 scripts/run-bench.sh`. -->
